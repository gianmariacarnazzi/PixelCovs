# PixelCovs
NFT project focused on PixelArt trend. Bot scripting using Selenium (first time: bad style, not efficient) to trick multiple images upload and avoid incurring into Smart Contract Deployment costs.

### Concept
The idea was to gain knowledge in Bot scripting and Image processing taking advantages of the potential benefits of the NFT industry. Starting from some templates drawn using Photoshop and other softwares, I wrote a python script to generate a pre-defined number of copies of those templates applying a randomization process to modify their pixels value and make them unique. The randomization process actually follows a specific pattern for each template in order not to modify the final shape. 

The templates represents an ironic version of the Sars-Cov-2 protein, which is reshaped into five different characters:

1. Pirate
2. Viking
3. Samurai
4. Clockwork Orange
5. Green beret

The characters choice lies in the idea of the virus as an enemy who brought suffering, pain and chaos in the world like war and other phenomenons represented by those characters do. Of course, the characters representation is playful. 

The selenium Bot allowed me to upload the images in batch without the need of writing and paying smart contracts fees. The platform chosen was OpenSea.
Unfortunately, without a heavy marketing campaign or an already settled community around the project, it is basically impossible to get visibility. Anyway, that was not the project aim. 

Thanks to NFTBirds for the inspiration!
